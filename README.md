# web-repl

Experiment. Can I create a small lib that you include and then start
in your app such that you can get a REPL going via a web browser?

The idea is that you start up your back-end application (Clojure on
the JVM). Then hit a web page and you can access the app via a REPL in
a browser.

Why?

So you can demo stuff and inspect stuff, say, in a review meeting of
some sort.
